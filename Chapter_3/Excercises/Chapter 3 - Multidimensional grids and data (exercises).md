# Chapter 3 - Multidimensional grids and data

## Exercises

#### 1. In this chapter we implemented a matrix multiplication kernel that has each thread produce one output matrix element. In this question, you will implement different matrix-matrix multiplication kernels and compare them.

#### a. Write a kernel that has each thread produce one output matrix row. Fill in the execution configuration parameters for the design.



#### b. Write a kernel that ahs each thread produce one output matrix column. Fill in the execution configuration parameters for the design.



#### c. Analyze the pros and cons of each of the two kernel designs.
